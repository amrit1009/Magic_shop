The world I always drown into whenever it becomes too hard to find myself in this one.

# Me core
I am a teenage girl who first picked up the pen out of loneliness, unaware that ink could become medicine. With every line I wrote, it felt as if I were softly pressing ointment onto invisible wounds—wounds my heart carried in silence. Somehow, the pages I filled began to hold me, heal me, and whisper back the peace I had long searched for. And now, with a steadier soul and a grateful smile, I am here ready to share this beautiful journey that writing has carved into my life.
